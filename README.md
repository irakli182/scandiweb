## SCANDWIEB JUNIOR WEB DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT 

Hello, my name is Irakli, developer of this project.

I will go over the technologies I have used, and how I implemented them.

## Structure of the project

For the assignment, the original requirement was to create an application using PHP and a MySQL database. However, I opted to utilize ReactJS for the front-end development. Consequently, my PHP files will no longer function as a front-end but instead will serve as an API to support the ReactJS application.

### Technologies

1) I created my frontend using reactJS and deployed it on vercel.
2) I created my API using PHP and deployed it using [HEROKU](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).  
3) I created mySQL databse using this website: https://www.freemysqlhosting.net

The assignment initially suggested using 000webhost as the hosting service. However, I made the choice to utilize HEROKU instead, primarily because 000webhost didn't support the use of PHP files as APIs.

In terms of database creation, while HEROKU offered the option to create databases, I decided to use the mentioned website for this purpose due to its accessibility to phpMyAdmin. This feature made the database management more straightforward compared to HEROKU's MySQL database, which required third-party apps for database viewing, making the process more complex and potentially cumbersome.

You can also access databsae using these credentials: 

phpMyAdmin: https://www.phpmyadmin.co

Server: sql11.freemysqlhosting.net <br>
Name: sql11654711 <br>
Username: sql11654711 <br>
Password: RA23f72DPL <br>
