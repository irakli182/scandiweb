## SCANDWIEB JUNIOR WEB DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT 

Hello, my name is Irakli, developer of this project.

I will go over the technologies I have used, and how I implemented them.

## Structure of the project

For the assignment, the original requirement was to create an application using PHP and a MySQL database. However, I opted to utilize ReactJS for the front-end development. Consequently, my PHP files will no longer function as a front-end but instead will serve as an API to support the ReactJS application.

### Technologies

1) I created my frontend using reactJS and deployed it on vercel.
2) I created my API using PHP and deployed it using [HEROKU](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).
> UPDATE!!! I had to migrate my API from heroku to [RAILWAY](https://railway.app). I had to make this change, beacause heroku free trial expired, and I decided to use RAILWAY as an alternative. This makes website a bit slower - that's the price to pay I guess :)
3) I created mySQL and hosted mySQL datase using [JawsDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/jawsdb).

The assignment initially suggested using 000webhost as the hosting service. However, I made the choice to utilize HEROKU instead, primarily because 000webhost didn't support the use of PHP files as APIs.

I've established a separate repository to store my PHP API files, and I've deployed these files using Heroku. For your convenience, I've included the PHP API files in this repository, making them accessible for inspection and review. You can find the PHP API files within the ```BACKEND``` directory.

When it came to setting up my database, I opted for Heroku, which I had already chosen as my API hosting platform. In this context, I made the logical decision to go with JawsDB MySQL, a free MySQL database hosting service provided by Heroku.

If you have an interest in accessing the database, please feel free to get in touch with me, and I'll be happy to provide you with the necessary credentials.
