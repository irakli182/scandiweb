## SCANDWIEB JUNIOR WEB DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT 

Hello, my name is Irakli, developer of this project.

I will go over the technologies I have used, and how I implemented them.

## Structure of the project

In the assignment, we were told to build an app using php and mysql database, however I decided to use reactJS as my front-end tool. Because of this deicison my PHP files would not serve as a front-end, but rather would act as an API.

### Technologies

1) I created my frontend using reactJS and deployed it on vercel.
2) I created my API using PHP and deployed it using [HEROKU](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).  
3) I created mySQL databse using this website: https://www.freemysqlhosting.net

Assignment mentioned 000webhost as a hosting service, but I decided to use HEROKU because 000webhost would not allow using PHP files as an API.
Creating database using HEROKU was also possible, but I decided to use above refferenced website for that purpose, because it has phpMYAdmin avaliable. Heroku's mySQL database did not allow it and downloading third party apps for viewing databases was neccesary - just headache.

I will add my PHP API files in a ```BACKEND``` directory.

You can also access databsae using these credentials: 

phpMyAdmin: https://www.phpmyadmin.co

Server: sql11.freemysqlhosting.net <br>
Name: sql11654711 <br>
Username: sql11654711 <br>
Password: RA23f72DPL <br>
